# Bear Course Hub

Final Project for UC Berkeley's Decal Course: Cubstart.

Inspired by BerkeleyTime and the Berkeley Academic Guide, which provide valuable information about various courses but lack support for mobile devices and personalization, the app allows students, especially those from Berkeley, to access information about different courses. It even enables them to import their own courses that are not listed in the app.

## Requirements

SwiftUI, SwiftData.
