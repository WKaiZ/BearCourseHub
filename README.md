# Bear Course Hub

Final Project for UC Berkeley's Decal Course: Cubstart.

Inspired by BerkeleyTime, Berkeley Academic Guide (both of these have valuable information about different courses, but do not generally support mobile devices and lack personalization).
Allows students (especially those from Berkeley) to view information about different courses (even importing their own courses that are not listed in the app)

## Requirements

SwiftUI, SwiftData.
